What is a **Network**?
A network is a group of two or more devices (like computers, phones, printers) that are connected together to share:

1.Data and files

2.Internet connection

3.Resources (like printers or servers)

Types of Networks

| Type                                | Description                        | Example                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **LAN** (Local Area Network)        | Small, local network               | Your home Wi-Fi or school lab  |
| **WAN** (Wide Area Network)         | Large-scale, long-distance network | The internet                   |
| **MAN** (Metropolitan Area Network) | City-wide network                  | Office buildings across a city |


Why Networks Are Important

1.Communication: Send emails, messages, or calls.

2.Sharing: Access files or printers across devices.

3.Remote access: Work from anywhere using internet-based networks.

4.Efficiency: Helps businesses connect systems and teams easily.

A **subnet** (short for subnetwork) is a smaller, logical part of a larger network. It helps organize and manage devices more efficiently.

Explanation:
Imagine your network is a big apartment building (main network), and each flat (subnet) holds a few residents (devices). All are part of the same building, but they are grouped to keep things organized.

A **subnet mask** defines how much of the IP address is the network part vs the host (device) part

### ðŸ†” What is a MAC ID (MAC Address)?

A **MAC ID**, or **MAC address** (**Media Access Control** address), is a **unique identifier** assigned to every device that connects to a network.

Think of it like your deviceâ€™s **permanent name tag** on the network.

### ðŸ“Œ Key Points:

* Itâ€™s **built into your deviceâ€™s network hardware** (like the Wi-Fi or Ethernet card).
* It **doesnâ€™t change**, even if your IP address does.
* Itâ€™s used for **identifying devices** on a **local network**.

### ðŸ”¢ Format:

A MAC address looks like this:

```
00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E
```

* Itâ€™s made up of **6 pairs of hexadecimal digits** (0â€“9, Aâ€“F).
* The first half shows the **manufacturer**, the second half is **unique to your device**.

---

### ðŸ§  Example Use:

* A router uses MAC addresses to **assign IP addresses** to devices.
* Schools/offices may **block or allow internet access** using MAC filters.
* MAC is used in **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** to map IP â†’ MAC for communication inside local networks.
